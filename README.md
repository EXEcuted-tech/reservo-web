## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setting Up the Project
1. Clone the project in any local directory you like
Example using the git CLI
```
git clone https://github.com/EXEcuted-tech/reservo-web.git
```
2. CD into the root folder
```
cd reservo-web
```
3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Run the project
```
npm run dev
```
**Bellow are some more detals about NPM scripts and commands**

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Commands To Run During Develompemnt

```

```
// TODO: Add commands here
```

## File Structure
1. `src\assets` - This is where you place images (.png, .svg, etc...)
2. `src\components` - Common components to be used throughout the application, you usually don't wanna touch this folder
3. `src\pages` - Pages of the website
4. `src\constants` - Global variables  
5. `src\common` -  Where common utils, style, and colors are compiled and accessed
```
Example for #6:
src
|__modules
        |__reservation
                    |__ index.js - Entry point for the reservation module
                    |__ style.js - Style import for the page
```
